Project Objective: The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application. The model will predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore based on historical data from resale flat transactions. By doing so, it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat accurately.

Motivation: The Singapore resale flat market is highly competitive, and accurately estimating the resale value of a flat can be challenging. Various factors, including location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration, influence resale prices. By developing a predictive model, we can provide users with an estimated resale price, helping them make informed decisions.
